if we get a send right that we've already got a copy of, will this try
to register a new dead name notification and fail an assert?

if we get a receive right that we've already got a send right for,
will this leave a dead name notification hanging?



instead of remote_ports_by_local, local_ports_by_remote, and local_port_type,
how about...

ports_by_local_name
ports_by_network_name

struct {
   mach_port_t local;
   mach_port_t network;
   int type (SEND or RECEIVE)
};
